				As a lifelong learner, I am always eager to acquire new skills and work
				collaboratively with others. I pride myself on being both hardworking
				and creative. My academic background includes an undergraduate degree in
				Oceanographic Science with a Visual Arts minor from Cal Poly Humboldt. I
				spent my 20s studying marine ecosystems, and my 30s teaching math and
				science in public and private schools. Throughout my career, I have had
				the opportunity to travel extensively, from the Channel Islands to the
				remote Pribilof Islands of the Bering Sea. Currently, I am settled in
				Bellingham, WA, where I live with my wife and young children. When I'm
				not spending quality time with my family, I enjoy coding and building
				things. I am passionate about pursuing a career where I can continuously
				learn and master new systems. I take pride in my strong work ethic and
				desire to help others, and I am seeking a work environment where these
				values are appreciated and valued.
