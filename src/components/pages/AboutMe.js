			<h1>About Rhys</h1>
			<p>
				I am a life-long learner who loves attaining new skills and working on
				teams. I am both hard-working and creative. My undergraduate degree from
				Cal Poly Humboldt was in Oceanographic Science and I minored in visual
				arts. I spent my 20's studying marine ecosystems and my 30's teaching
				math and science in public and private schools. My travels took me from
				the Channel Islands to the remote Pribilof Islands of the Bering Sea.
				I'm now settled in Bellingham WA, where I own a home with my wife and
				young children. I enjoy coding, spending time with my family, and
				building things. I'm looking for a profession where I can continually
				learn and master new systems, and where my efforts contribute to the
				success of the company or organization.
